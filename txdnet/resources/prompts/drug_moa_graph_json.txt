The following text describes a graph (aka network) containing biological entities and relations between them involved in the mechanism of action of a drug on one more diseases:

--- BEGIN DESCRIPTION ---
{description}
--- END DESCRIPTION ---

Convert this description into a structed graph representation in node-link JSON format, using all of the above context where necessary. Requirements:

- Include at least all of the entities (nodes) and relations (edges) included in the description
- Use integer ids for the nodes and a `label` property containing their names
- Add a node `type` property that best captures what kind of node it is
- Include an edge `type` property describing the nature of the relation between nodes 
- Ensure that at least one path exists from the drug to each disease, but do so by constructing paths through as many relevant intermediaries as possible
- Add edges where necessary to ensure that ALL entities are connected to at least one other entity through an appropriate edge/relation.

Here is an example showing a partial response with placeholder values:

--- BEGIN EXAMPLE JSON ---
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{"id": $node_integer_id, "label": $node_label, "type": $node_type}},
    ...
  ],
  "links": [
    {{"source": $node_integer_id_1, "target": $node_integer_id_2, "type": $edge_type}},
    ...
  ]
}}
--- END EXAMPLE JSON ---
