Text will be provided that contains information about the mechanism of action for a particular drug.

Identify any proteins, genes, variants, phenotypes, metabolites, pathways, biological functions or other biological entities of any kind that are linked to the pathogenesis of any diseases named as indications for the drug.

Requirements:

- Assume the intent of this information will be to build a graph/network containing these entities and the relations between them
- Ignore any information that cannot be implicated (directly or indirectly) in a mechanistic link between the drug and any one disease
- Include as much detail as possible about these mechanistic links by enumerating all entities and relations that are a part of them
- Ensure that at least one path exists from the drug to each disease, but do so by constructing paths through as many relevant intermediaries as possible
- Add edges where necessary to ensure that ALL entities are connected to at least one other entity through an appropriate edge/relation.

Let's think step by step.  List the nodes first and then the types of edges/relations.  Attempt to categorize the entities and relations as well, such that those with sufficient likeliness have the same category.

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
Rituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human B-lymphocyte-restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35), a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kD located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on > 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation.

B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production.

Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.
